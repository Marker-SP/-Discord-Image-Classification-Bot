This discord bot tells you which game the game logo you send (only valid for FIFA, Fortnite, LOL, Minecraft and Valorant) belongs to. To do this, 
it adds the image of the game logo you posted to a folder called images and reads it, classifies it through some artificial intelligence codes and gives you the result.

There are some game logo pictures you can use to test it...
